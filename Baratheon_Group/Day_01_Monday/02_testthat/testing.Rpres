testthat
========

One of *many* excellent libraries from Hadley Wickam to make highly readable tests.

So what's a test?

A trivial example
=================

Ensure that a function returns `TRUE`. 

```{r}
require(testthat)

my_trivial_function <- function() TRUE

test_that(
  "my trivial function returns TRUE", 
  {
    # Braces not actually needed
    # for a single expression...
    expect_that(my_trivial_function(), 
                equals(TRUE))
  }
)
```

(I'm not sure how to actually test a knitr doc, though)

Less Verbosity
==============

Some people (like me) don't buy as much into the "BDD" mindset (cf. Ruby's RSpec):

```{r}
require(testthat)

my_trivial_function <- function() TRUE

test_that(
  "my trivial function returns TRUE", 
  {
    # Braces not actually needed
    # for a single expression...
    expect_true(my_trivial_function())
  }
)
```
